# Anomaly detection group project
# Project Description

During this project our data science team explored the most and least visited topics in the web development and data science  curriculums at CodeUp. This also consisted of investigating if students had access to the correct information during their time as a student and graduate. The link to our github final report can be found here and our slide presentation can be found here. 

Our Findings have been listed below : 

For Web Dev cohorts with the top 5 most log observations (Ceres, Zion, Jupiter, Fortuna, Voyageurs):
Fortuna accessed the java-iii lesson more frequently than the other 4 cohorts investigated.
Ceres and Jupiter accessed html-css more often than Jupiter, Fortuna, and Voyageur

For the 5 Data Science cohorts with log observations ( Darden, Bayes, Curie, Easley, Florence):
Darden viewed the classification/overview lesson the most out of all 5 cohorts by a significant margin. Dardin had 1109 instances of this lesson, which 664 more instances than the next highest cohort, Easley

Curriculum Access Notes For Permission Admins:
It seems access was completely shut off before 2019 but not after 2019 for web development. There are  instances of web development students accessing data science curriculum even after graduation. For the Data Science classes access to web development content was shut down before and after 2019.
